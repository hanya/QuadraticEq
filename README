  Spreadsheet functions for quadratic equation
  
    This extension contains the following functions that can be 
    used on Spreadsheet of OpenOffice kind.

  quadratic(a;b;c;type)
  
    Calculates solution of the quadratic equation: 
    ax^2+bx+c=0
    x=(-b+-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a
    When type is 0, result of (-b+sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a is returned, 
    and when type is 1, (-b-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a is returned.
    This function returns complex value if b^2 < 4ac.



  How to Build
    Setup OpenOffice SDK and load its environmental variables.
    > make
    You would find created package under files directory.

  Translation
    Copy from po/strings.pot file to your target language and
